DevWave by Ayush Sharma
Made As a project for learning purposes

I have myself wrote all the html and .js files (except jquery and .) in this project while taking some layout and design ideas and inspirations online.
I want to specify that most of the CSS code used in this project is collection of functioning snippets already found online.
I have used these snippets together to make a functional website. That said most of the CSS code might not have been written by me 
but i have compiled these resources myself and am aware about the functionality of each snippet used in here.
